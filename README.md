# covid-mapping-project

This project is part of the work done for the Google-Sponsored Computer Science Compupting Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with one other team member, @anaalfarogarciaa.

The project was written mainly in javascript using the p5.js library to build an interactive map of covid-related statistics across the United States. You will be prompted to choose a color scheme for the map and which statistic you would like to view. You can then zoom in and out of the map and drag the map to change your view.

To run this project you need to download this repository and run the index.htlm file in a web browser.
